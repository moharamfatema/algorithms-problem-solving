## 1. Sum of Strings:

### files associated:
1. `sumOfStr.cpp`
2. `testsumofstr.cpp`

### Problem statement:
>Given two *non-negative integers*, `num1` and `num2` represented >as *string*, return the sum of `num1` and `num2` as a *string*.
>
>You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for >handling large integers (such as BigInteger). You must also not >convert the inputs to integers directly.

### status:

### Problem statement:
>Given an array of intervals where `intervals[i]` = `[starti, endi]
>`, Select the maximum number of activities that can be performed 
>by a single person, assuming that a person can only work on a 
>single activity at a given day.

## 3. Longest Common Subsequence
### Dynamic programming
### Problem statement:
>Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their >longest **common subsequence**. If there is no common >subsequence, return `0`.
>
>A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the >original string with some characters (can be none) deleted >without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
>
>    For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
>
>A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is >common to both strings.

## 4. Robot Bounded In Circle
### Topics :  
    Math , String, Simulation.     
### Problem statement:
>On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at `(0, 0)` and >faces `north`. The robot can receive one of three instructions:
>
>*    "G": go straight 1 unit;
>*    "L": turn 90 degrees to the left;
>*    "R": turn 90 degrees to the right.
>
>The robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats >them forever.
>
>Return `true` if and only if there exists a circle in the plane >such that the robot never leaves the circle.

## 5. Course Schedule III
### Topics :  
    Greedy , Heap(Priority Queue).       
### Problem statement:
>There are ``n`` different online courses numbered from ``1`` to `n`. You are given an array `courses` where `courses[i] = [durationi, lastDayi]` indicate that the ith course should be taken continuously for `durationi` days and must be finished before or on `lastDayi`.
>
>You will start on the 1st day and you cannot take two or more courses simultaneously.
>
>Return the maximum number of courses that you can take.

## 7. Sort Colors
### Topics :  
    Array, Sorting.       
### Problem statement:
>Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort 
>them 
>**in-place** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in 
>the order red, white, and blue.
>
>We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and 
>blue, respectively.
>
>You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.
