## 1. Sum of Strings:

### files associated:
1. `sumOfStr.cpp`
2. `testsumofstr.cpp`

### Problem statement:
Given two *non-negative integers*, `num1` and `num2` represented as *string*, return the sum of `num1` and `num2` as a *string*.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as BigInteger). You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.

## 2. Activity selection
### greedy
### Problem statement:
Given an array of intervals where `intervals[i]` = `[starti, endi]`, Select the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person, assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a given day.

## 3. Longest Common Subsequence
## Dynamic programming
### Problem statement:
Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest **common subsequence**. If there is no common subsequence, return `0`.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

    For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".

A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
